        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>I worked on many different projects. My favorite project required me to code a java program that would read a file full of different numbers on any computer you ran it on. It would then take all the numbers find the sample size, average, minimum and maximum number, and standard deviation. It would ouput all the information in a neat and easy to read format.</p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>I have just started learning python so many of my projects are very simple. I can calculate formulas and output them with certain formatting.In the future when I am more knowledgeable I would like to use python to make my own AI assistant.</p>

        <h3>HTML,CSS, and JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Some of my projects are very simple however it is important to ingrain good habits and standard practice. I've built a website about cats. It would show images of cats and would allow you to input information on your own cat in a form. I also designed a cafe menu using CSS and made it very enjoyable to look at and order from.</p>
